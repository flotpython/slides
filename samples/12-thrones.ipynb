    "1. **simulation**\n",
    "\n",

    "  * so once this graph is ready, we can write a simulation tool that walks the graph randomly following the *rules of the game* explained above\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **observation** \n",
    "  * running the simulation several times with different lifespans rangin from several hops to a few thousands, we can experimentally check if we indeed obtain consistent results, i.e. constant results for all characters"
