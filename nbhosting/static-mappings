# mappings that need to be created in all subdirs
# (that have at least one notebook)
# so for example with the settings below,
# once a student has opened slides/01-introduction.ipynb
# then in his working directory there will be
# slides/
#   01-introduction.ipynb
#   data -> /nbhosting/static/python-slides/data
#   media -> /nbhosting/static/python-slides/media
#   rise.css -> /nbhosting/static/python-slides/media/rise.css
static -> static
media -> media
rise.css -> media/rise.css
